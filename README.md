# ðŸ’³ Credit EDA & Credit Score Calculation with Python

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the calculation of a **credit score** for individuals based on a given dataset. The dataset contains information about customers' financial activities, including income, loans, delayed payments, and credit utilization. The goal is to identify patterns in the data, uncover meaningful insights, and calculate a hypothetical credit score to assess customers' creditworthiness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's structure and key trends.
2. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
3. Develop a hypothetical **Credit Score Calculation Model** based on key variables.
4. Generate actionable insights for financial institutions to improve customer credit management.
